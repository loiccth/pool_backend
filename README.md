# Introduction
The backend is a RESTful API built with Express, Firestore, and Node.js.

### Key Features:
1. User Management:
    - **Firebase Admin SDK** is used for backend user authentication and managing user data in Firebase.
    - User data can be securely stored, updated, and managed using Firebaseâ€™s real-time database or Firestore.

2. Security and Authentication:
    - **Generate Password** module to generate strong, random passwords for user accounts, ensuring account security.
    - **dotenv** is used to securely store environment variables such as API keys, passwords, and database credentials in a `.env` file.

3. Email and Notification Services:
    - **Mailgun** integration to send transactional emails like account registration, password resets, and promotional emails.
    - **Nodemailer** used as a mailing library to send emails through SMTP servers.
    - **Twilio** integration for sending users SMS notifications, alerts, or reminders.

4. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):
    - **CORS** middleware enables or restricts cross-origin requests, allowing secure communication between the backend API and frontend applications hosted on different domains.

5. Payment Processing:
    - **Stripe** integration for handling payment transactions, including payment intent creation, subscription management, and payment gateway interactions.
    - Secure payment handling to process both one-time payments and recurring subscriptions.

6. API Logging and Monitoring:
    - **Morgan** for logging HTTP requests in the application, which is useful for debugging, error tracking, and performance monitoring.

7. Scheduled Tasks:
    - **Cron** jobs are utilized to schedule recurring tasks like checking for expired reservations.

8. Real-time Database Interaction:
    - **Firebase Admin SDK** also provides access to Firebase services such as the Firestore database, allowing real-time updates and interactions within the app.
  

# Enhancements:
- Use TypeScript instead of plain JavaScript to detect type-related errors at compile time.
- Use a Decentralized Architecture like making use of microservices.
